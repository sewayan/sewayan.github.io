				<h1> <strong> Hi! Nice to see you here! </strong> </h1>	
				<p> Please allow me to introduce myself real quick. <br> My name is Sebastian and I will run this website to keep track on the things I learn about Front-End Development <br> So here is what you will find when you navigate through this website: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Home: The nifty home screen</li>
					<li>About: Some rambling from me, about me</li>
					<li>Links: links to things that could be interesting...maybe</li>
					<li>Contact: just in case you want to reach out!</li>
				</ul>

				<h3> <strong> Why, Sebastian? Why...? </strong> </h3>
				<p> After graduating I jumped head first into the corporate world. I joined one of the largest automotive manufacturers in one of their marketing departments before taking a chance and entering the IT world as a Consultant <br> I enjoyed these times, made experiences, learned and worked in places like Tokyo, Fukuoka, Kuala Lumpur or Frankfurt. I got along with my co-workers and in my role I gained access to multiple industries, getting a glimpse "behind the scenes". Soooo, again. Why would you change something then? <br> While working on those projects, I realized that we are having an impact, which I enjoyed, but everything I did just cotributed indirectly. Over the time I felt like something is missing. Until I realized that <i><u>I need to create!</u></i></p>

				<h2> And this is why I am here! </h2>
				<p> So tag along and let's learn something new, everyday!	 </p>
